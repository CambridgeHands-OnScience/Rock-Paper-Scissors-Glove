# Rock Paper Scissors Glove
This code is used as part of the Cambridge Hands-On Science Experiment 'Rock, Paper, Scissors, Glove'. A explination and risks of the experiment can be found on our website. The glove was inspired by the project by Kaz Sato (kazunori279) and this modified glove was built for under Â£35. We used two 2.2 inch flex sensors on the second and fifth finger, an arduino mini and servo motor. 

This repository forks Sato's original and the blog post bellow was used for advice in construction. The code is similar however adapted for use with one fewer sensor!
